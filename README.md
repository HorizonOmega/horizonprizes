# Horizon Prizes

## Introduction

Horizon Prizes is a decentralized platform designed to transform research
funding by automating and democratizing the process of managing and distributing
research prizes. Built on the Stellar blockchain with Soroban smart contracts,
it focuses on enhancing transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in funding
research, particularly in critical domains like AI safety.

## Project Overview

Horizon Prizes leverages blockchain technology to:

- **Facilitate transparent prize management**: Utilizing customizable smart
  contracts for creating and managing research prizes.
- **Automate distribution**: Ensuring fair and timely award distribution through
  smart contract automation.
- **Enhance global accessibility**: Making it easy for researchers and funders
  worldwide to participate through a simple web interface.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized operations**: All transactions and operations are recorded on
  the blockchain to ensure transparency.
- **Automated award system**: Prizes are automatically awarded to winners based
  on predefined criteria.
- **Community-driven evaluations**: The platform supports community-driven
  evaluation processes, enhancing democratic participation in research
  directions.

## Vision and Goals

Our goal is to accelerate innovation in research by reducing bureaucratic
overhead and aligning incentives between funders and researchers. By
streamlining the funding process, Horizon Prizes aims to:

- **Accelerate research output**: Shorten the cycle from idea to implementation.
- **Drive collaborative efforts**: Foster a collaborative ecosystem that
  supports and rewards innovative solutions.
